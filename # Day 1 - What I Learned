# 🌐 Virtualization — DevOps Journey Day 1

## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computer systems inside your physical machine.

Instead of buying 5 different computers to run different operating systems (like Linux, Windows, etc.), you can run them all virtually on a single machine.

## Key Concepts

### 🔸 Virtual Machine (VM)
- A **Virtual Machine** is like a computer inside your computer.
- It has its own virtual CPU, memory, disk, and operating system.
- You can run multiple VMs on a single machine.

> Example: You can run Ubuntu Linux inside your Windows laptop as a VM.

### 🔸 Hypervisor
A **hypervisor** is software that creates and manages Virtual Machines.

#### Two Types of Hypervisors:
1. **Type 1 (Bare-metal)**  
   - Runs directly on hardware  
   - Faster and more efficient  
   - Used in enterprise systems  
   - Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V

2. **Type 2 (Hosted)**  
   - Runs inside an existing OS (like an app)  
   - Easier to set up for learning  
   - Examples: VirtualBox, VMware Workstation

## Why is Virtualization important in DevOps?

✅ You can simulate multiple servers on a single laptop  
✅ It saves hardware costs  
✅ You can test apps in different environments  
✅ Helps learn cloud, containers, automation (like Docker, Kubernetes)

## Tools Mentioned in My Course
- **VirtualBox** – Type 2 hypervisor (used to run VMs)
- **Ubuntu** – A popular Linux distro for practice
- **VMware** – Enterprise virtualization tool

## What I Learned Today
- The difference between virtualization, VM, and hypervisors
- The types of hypervisors and how VMs are created
- That I don’t need multiple machines — virtualization makes DevOps learning easier and cheaper
