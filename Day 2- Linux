🧠 Day 2 - Terminal Survival Begins (Linux)

Might be basic for most, but I'm just starting out — taking notes and tracking my progress as I go)))

## 📘 What I Learned Today

### 1. **Navigating Directories**

* `pwd` → shows where I am (present working directory).
* `ls` → shows what’s inside the current folder.
* `cd foldername` → go into a folder.
* `cd ..` → go one step back (to parent directory).
* `cd ~` → go back to the home folder.

🧠 *I realized navigating Linux is kinda like finding my way in a dark room with a flashlight.*

### 2. **Creating & Deleting**

* `mkdir foldername` → make a new folder.
* `touch filename.txt` → make a new empty file.
* `rm filename` → delete a file.
* `rm -r foldername` → delete a folder and everything inside.

😅 *Almost deleted the wrong thing. Scary but fun.*

---

### 3. **Absolute vs Relative Paths**

* **Absolute path** → starts from root `/` (like full home address).

  * Example: `/home/eldorbeeey/Documents/myfile.txt`
* **Relative path** → starts from where I currently am.

  * Example: `../Downloads` (go up one level, then into Downloads)

🧭 *Learning this felt like learning directions in a new city.*

---

### 4. **Intro to Vim**

* `vim filename` → opens file in Vim.
* Press `i` → to start writing.
* Press `Esc` → to stop writing.
* Type `:w` → to save.
* Type `:q` → to quit.
* `:wq` → save and quit.

💀 *Tried to exit Vim. Failed. Cried. Googled. Finally escaped.*

## 🔧 Bonus: Saw This Mysterious File

Found a file named `devops_course_setup.sh` in my home directory. I didn’t create it, but it's probably from my DevOps course.

✅ Checked which tools are installed using `--version` commands.

---

## 📦 Tools Checked:

```bash
vagrant --version   
virtualbox --version 
```

📌 Installing and using these is next on my list!

## 🔥 Reflections

Today I:

* Faced my fear of the terminal.
* Got confused, panicked, and kept going.
* Made a folder and deleted it like a pro.
* Opened Vim and survived.

📅 **Tomorrow’s goal**: Understand what Vagrant is, why it needs VirtualBox, and actually run my first VM.

## 🙌 Ending Note:

I’m documenting this journey publicly to:

* Keep myself accountable,
* Help other beginners feel less scared,
* And one day look back and laugh at how “pwd” once felt confusing.
